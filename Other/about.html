        <h1>About Fresh & Local Restaurant</h1>
        <p>Fresh & Local is a small, independently owned restaurant that focuses on using locally sourced ingredients to create fresh, flavourful dishes. Our restaurant was founded by a chef who is passionate about supporting local farmers and producers, and wanted to create a dining experience that celebrates the abundance of fresh, seasonal ingredients available in the region.</p>

        <p>We believe that using locally sourced ingredients not only supports the local economy and reduces the carbon footprint of our restaurant, but it also allows us to serve the freshest, most flavourful dishes possible. Our menu changes seasonally to take advantage of the freshest ingredients available in the region.</p>
